# Installation

Get your documentation site up and running in just a few minutes.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- A web server (Apache, Nginx, or PHP's built-in server)

## Installation Steps


### 1. Configure Your Site

Edit the `config.php` file to customize your documentation site:

```php
return [
    'site_name' => 'Your Documentation',
    'site_description' => 'Your project documentation',
    'default_page' => 'getting-started/introduction',
    'github_repo' => 'https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo',
];
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

For local development, you can use PHP's built-in web server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Production Deployment

For production, configure your web server to point to the project directory and ensure the `.htaccess` file is being read (for Apache) or configure URL rewriting for Nginx.

#### Apache Configuration

The included `.htaccess` file handles URL rewriting automatically.

#### Nginx Configuration

Add this to your Nginx configuration:

```bash
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have WharfDocs installed, learn about the [Project Structure](project-structure) to understand how to organize your documentation files.
