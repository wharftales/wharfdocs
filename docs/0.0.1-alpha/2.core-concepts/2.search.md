# Search Functionality

WharfDocs includes a powerful built-in search feature that helps users quickly find the information they need.

## How Search Works

The search system automatically:

1. **Indexes all documentation** on page load
2. **Searches through titles, headings, and content**
3. **Ranks results** by relevance
4. **Highlights matching terms** in search results

## Search Indexing

When the documentation engine initializes, it:

- Scans all Markdown files in the `docs/` directory
- Extracts titles, headings, and content
- Creates a searchable index in memory
- Removes Markdown syntax for clean text search

## Search Algorithm

The search algorithm prioritizes results based on:

1. **Title matches** (highest priority - 100 points)
2. **Heading matches** (medium priority - 50 points per match)
3. **Content matches** (10 points per occurrence)

Results are sorted by score and limited to the top 10 matches.

## Using Search

### From the UI

1. Click the search box in the header
2. Type your query (minimum 2 characters)
3. Results appear in real-time as you type
4. Click any result to navigate to that page

### Search Tips

- **Be specific**: More specific queries return better results
- **Use keywords**: Search for important terms from your topic
- **Try variations**: If you don't find what you need, try different words
- **Check spelling**: Typos won't match content

## API Endpoint

Search is also available via API:

```bash
GET /api/search?q=your+query
```

Response format:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "getting-started/introduction",
    "title": "Introduction",
    "excerpt": "Welcome to <mark>WharfDocs</mark>...",
    "score": 150
  }
]
```

## Customizing Search

You can customize search behavior by modifying `src/SearchIndexer.php`:

```php
// Change result limit
return array_slice($results, 0, 20); // Show 20 results

// Adjust scoring weights
if (stripos($titleLower, $query) !== false) {
    $score += 200; // Increase title match weight
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Index is built on initialization**: First page load may be slightly slower
- **Search is performed in-memory**: Very fast for small to medium documentation sites
- **No database required**: Keeps the system simple and portable

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for search:

- Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
- Search suggestions and autocomplete
- Filter by section or category
- Search history
- Advanced search operators
